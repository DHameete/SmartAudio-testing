# SmartAudio-testing
This is an experiment for interfacing TBS VTX with an Arduino.
Here an Arduino Leonardo compatible board with 3.3V regulator was used. Serial is the virtual serial port which allows controlling the VTX via commands. On hardware serial 1 rx and tx are both connected to the SmartAudio pin of a TBS Unify.
